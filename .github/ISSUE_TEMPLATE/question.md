**Question**
A clear and concise description of your question.

**Existing resources**
Before submitting this question, please check if it has been answered in a previous [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ethz-asl/wavemap/issues?q=is%3Aissue).

If the question is about the theory behind wavemap, it might already be addressed in our [RSS paper](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss19/p065.pdf).

If you would like to reproduce the results from our [RSS paper](https://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss19/p065.pdf), please refer to the [Demo](https://ethz-asl.github.io/wavemap/pages/demos.html) documentation page.

If you need help configuring wavemap on a custom dataset, the [Configuration](https://ethz-asl.github.io/wavemap/pages/configuration.html) documentation page might be helpful.

**Images**
If it helps to explain your question, please include screenshots, plots or sketches.
